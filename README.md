### Challenges

Yes, this project looks easier than it looks, and I had a handful of difficulties I had to overcome, and was fortunate enough to have several instructors and colleagues help me out when I needed it. Some challenges including using the right jQuery methods, especially in my ui.js files, for when a user makes a specific action and a response is rendered in return. Another challenge I worked through was constantly logging different arguments and iterators to see what they would return and if they returned what I wanted for a specific function.

### Upcoming bugs/issues that need to be fixed in the future

One issue that I eventually want to resolve is the ability to show the gameboard once a player presses the new game button; I ideally want it hidden to the user at first before pressing the new game button. Another slight issue that I eventually want to resolve is when a player starts a new game after winning or tieing, it still says "X/O wins!" or "It's a tie!", from the previous game, which I want to clear whenever the player presses new game. Another final issue that I eventually want to resolve is that whenever a user presses on a cell that's already taken, then I want a message to display that the cell has already been taken.
