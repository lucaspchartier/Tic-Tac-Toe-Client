# Challenges

### Yes, this project looks easier than it looks, and I had a handful of difficulties I had to overcome, and was fortunate enough to have several instructors and colleagues help me out when I needed it. A lot of the times, I had to post issues and bugs that I had trouble with in the issue cue, where I would receive remote consulting on how to fix the bugs that may affect gameplay and functionality.

# Upcoming bugs/issues that need to be fixed in the future

### Several issues that I intend to fix over the next couple of weeks include but are not limited to, fixing the draw function to indicate that a draw has occured between X and O, removing authentication and game messages after first appearing (i.e. after a user has signed in or a new game has been created), another issue I have also encountered that I intend to fix is the fact that a player has the ability to switch their letter on a square during a turn, which is a big no-no.
